## Version Notes for 6.0.0

ExpressionEngine 6.0.0 brings significant changes, most of which are handled automatically in the update process.

The following list are items that you will want to be aware of.

- The Rich Text Editor (RTE) can no longer be applied to fields via the ` {exp:rte:script_url}` tag.
- Displaying an RTE field in the Channel Form's channel entry loop should be done using `{display_field}` rather than manually constructing a textarea field.
- A number of new language keys have been added. Custom languages will need to be updated for 6.0.
